# Expense-Management-System
### The Expense Management System is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) full-stack project designed to streamline and enhance personal expense tracking.

With this system, users can effortlessly log their expenditures by inputting details such as expense amount, description, and date. The system then diligently organizes and records these entries, creating an organized repository of financial activities.

One of its standout features is the dashboard that presents users with detailed insights into their spending patterns. This dashboard provides a visual representation of expenses over time, allowing users to identify trends, areas of high expenditure, and potential cost-cutting opportunities.
